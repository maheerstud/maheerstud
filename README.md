- 👋 Hi, I’m @maheerstud
- 👀 I’m interested in Technology 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Cyber Security 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Open-source projects related to Cyber Security,software development and data science.
- i'm always open to new opportunities and challenges.
- 📫 How to reach me (maheerstud@gmail.com)
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact:  🕵️‍♂️ I’ve hacked my own devices (for educational purposes, of course!) to understand security vulnerabilities.
- 🔐 I have a secret collection of random passwords, but I **always** use a password manager to keep them safe.
- 🛡️ I once spent an entire weekend solving Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges – no regrets!
- 💻 I love reverse-engineering software just to see how things tick (sometimes it’s like decoding a mystery).
- 🎮 I enjoy playing "ethical hacking" games where I get to use my skills to prevent cyber-attacks in a virtual world.
- 👨‍💻 I’ve probably spent more time reading about firewalls, encryption, and malware than most people spend on Netflix.
- 🦠 I find it both terrifying and fascinating how viruses and malware can evolve, just like a biological pathogen.
- 🌍 Cybersecurity is like a never-ending game of cat and mouse – the hackers try to find ways in, and we work tirelessly to keep them out.
- 💡 Sometimes, the best hack is simply thinking like a bad guy (but with good intentions)!
- 🎯 My dream job? A penetration tester who uncovers vulnerabilities before the bad guys do.
